# SkinHouse

The scene is a room with Obama in cube form, and all the furniture is made of human skin. I got all my models from an apartment kit on the asset store, bundled in this link https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/apartment-kit-124055. I got inspiration from Obama memes, and the skin thing was the result of a blender tutorial that I followed while learning about procedural shaders. The main character in the scene is Obama Cube.

The objects in my scene are as follows:
Obama Cube (main character)
Bed
Stand-up wardrobe
Dresser
End table
Smaller, different end table
Lamp
Mirror (looks more like a painting because of the skin)
Floor and walls
Corner cabinet
Base cabinet
Slim base cabinet
Sink Cabinet
Shelf
Tall cabinet (on the fridge)
Fridge
Wall corner cabinet
Wall cabinet
Short wall cabinet
Oven hood
Stove

I also amde the skin, obama, and skybox materials myself
